# Introduction

## From Physical Therapy to Programming: The Origin of This Project

My name is Ramiro, and for several years I worked as a physical therapist specializing in home care. Day after day, visiting patients in their homes, I faced the challenges of coordinating schedules, managing clinical records, and optimizing time to provide quality care. Home care is a field where empathy, organization, and efficiency are essential, but also one where technological tools are often limited or poorly adapted to the real needs of independent professionals or small teams.

As I explored new ways to address these challenges, I discovered programming as a powerful tool to design concrete solutions. My transition into software development was not a sudden leap, but a gradual decision based on the need to build something useful using the knowledge I had accumulated in the field. This project was born precisely at that intersection: an app designed from real-world experience, aimed at improving the daily work of those who provide home care services.

### The Motivation Behind the Application

The goal of this application is clear: to provide an intuitive and efficient tool that simplifies appointment management, patient tracking, and the organization of administrative tasks for independent professionals or small home care teams. The idea is not only to automate processes, but to do so in a way that respects the unique aspects of working in patients’ homes, where flexibility and personalization are key.

In addition, this project is an opportunity to apply and showcase solid technical knowledge. From designing a scalable software architecture to implementing development best practices—such as version control, clear documentation, and automated testing—this application aims to be an example of how a project can combine practical utility with technical excellence.

### What’s Next in This Documentation?

In the following sections, we’ll explore the project’s details: from functional and non-functional requirements to the chosen software architecture, the technologies used (such as Astro and Starlight for this documentation), and the development process. My goal is for this documentation to serve not only as a guide to the application’s development but also as a resource for other developers who, like me, seek to merge their previous experience with the world of software development.
