## Welcome to Domi Health

## From Healthcare Practice to Digital Innovation

After more than **20 years** as a licensed physiotherapist, I made a pivotal decision in 2020: to transition into software development. This wasn't just a career change—it was the beginning of a mission to bridge two worlds I'm passionate about.

**Domi Health** represents the intersection of my healthcare expertise and newfound programming skills, creating solutions that address real-world challenges I've encountered throughout my career in physiotherapy and home healthcare services.

## The Vision Behind Domi Health

Working in healthcare for over two decades, I've witnessed firsthand the administrative challenges that healthcare teams face daily. From managing patient records scattered across different systems to coordinating care among multidisciplinary teams, the inefficiencies were clear.

**Domi Health** was born from this understanding. It's designed specifically for **home healthcare teams** and **domiciliary care services**, focusing on:

- **Streamlined patient management** that actually works in real-world scenarios
- **Tools that save time** rather than create additional administrative burden
- **Intuitive interfaces** that don't require extensive training
- **Scalable solutions** that grow with your practice

## Who This Is For

### Healthcare Professionals

- **Physiotherapists** managing home visit schedules
- **Domiciliary care teams** coordinating patient care
- **Healthcare administrators** seeking efficient patient management
- **Small to medium healthcare practices** looking to digitize their workflows

### Developers & Healthcare Innovators

- **Healthcare IT professionals** interested in modern web solutions
- **Developers** looking to understand healthcare domain challenges
- **Students** exploring the intersection of healthcare and technology

## What Makes This Different

Unlike generic healthcare management systems, Domi Health is built by someone who has:

- ✅ **Managed hundreds of patients** in home healthcare settings
- ✅ **Experienced the pain points** of existing healthcare software
- ✅ **Understood the workflows** that actually matter in daily practice
- ✅ **Balanced clinical needs** with administrative efficiency

This isn't theoretical—it's practical software born from real healthcare experience.

## The Journey Ahead

This documentation will guide you through:

1. **Getting started** with the application
2. **Understanding the architecture** and design decisions
3. **Exploring features** built for real healthcare scenarios
4. **Contributing** to a project that can genuinely help healthcare teams

Whether you're a healthcare professional curious about the technical side, or a developer interested in healthcare applications, this project represents a unique perspective where clinical experience meets modern web development.
