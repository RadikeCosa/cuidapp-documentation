# Introduction

## From Kinesiology to Programming: The Origin of This Project

My name is Ramiro, and for several years, I have worked as a kinesiologist specializing in home care. Day after day, visiting patients in their homes, I faced the challenges of coordinating schedules, managing clinical records, and optimizing time to provide quality care. Home care is a field where empathy, organization, and efficiency are essential, but also where technological tools are often limited or poorly adapted to the real needs of independent professionals or small teams.

This experience led me to a recurring question: how could technology simplify and enhance the work of professionals like me? That’s when, inspired by my passion for problem-solving and my curiosity for programming, I decided to embark on a career shift toward software development. This project was born from that transition: an application designed for home care professionals, created from the perspective of someone who knows the sector’s needs firsthand.

### The Motivation Behind the Application

The goal of this application is clear: to provide an intuitive and efficient tool that simplifies appointment management, patient tracking, and administrative task organization for independent professionals or small home care teams. The idea is not just to automate processes but to do so in a way that respects the unique aspects of working in patients’ homes, where flexibility and personalization are key.

Moreover, this project is an opportunity to apply and showcase solid technical knowledge. From designing a scalable software architecture to implementing best development practices—such as version control, clear documentation, and automated testing—this application aims to be an example of how a project can combine practical utility with technical excellence.

### What’s Next in This Documentation?

In the following sections, we will explore the project’s details: from functional and non-functional requirements to the chosen software architecture, the technologies used (such as Astro and Starlight for this documentation), and the development process. My goal is for this documentation to serve not only as a guide for the application’s development but also as a resource for other developers who, like me, seek to merge their prior experience with the world of software development.
