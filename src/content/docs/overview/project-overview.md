The home care application is designed to streamline workflows for independent home care professionals and small teams, such as physicians, physical therapists, nurses, speech therapists, and occupational therapists. Drawing from the creatorâ€™s experience as a kinesiologist, the app addresses real-world challenges faced by home care providers, offering a tailored solution to enhance efficiency and organization in patient care.

Purpose and Target Audience

This application serves home care professionals who need an intuitive, reliable tool to manage their daily operations. Whether working solo or in small teams, these providers often lack software designed specifically for their unique needs. The app simplifies administrative tasks and patient management, allowing professionals to focus on delivering quality care.

Key Features

The application's core features are designed to support home care workflows effectively:

Patient Record Management: Collect, store, and display critical patient information, accessible through a detailed view for each individual.

Task Organization: Efficiently manage both administrative and care-related tasks.

Dashboard and Patient List: A centralized dashboard provides access to a complete patient list, with a side navigation bar for quick access to key modules.

Smart Scheduling and Collaboration: Leverage existing tools to create intelligent work routes, calculate travel times, and organize a shared agenda with other professionals and patients. This ensures everyone stays up-to-date with upcoming visits and relevant information.

Problems Solved

Home care professionals often face inefficiencies due to generic tools or manual processes that fail to address their specific needs. This app tackles these issues by providing an organized, user-friendly interface with good UX and performance. By prioritizing relevant patient information and streamlining access, it reduces administrative burdens and enhances care delivery.

Project Scope

The initial release focuses on the patient module, which collects, stores, and displays essential patient data. A key challenge is determining what information is most relevant and prioritizing its display for maximum utility. Future expansions may include integrations with maps for visit planning or messaging APIs for improved communication, building on the core functionality to meet evolving needs.
