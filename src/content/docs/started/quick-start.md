## Quick Start Guide

Welcome to your first hands-on experience with Domi Health! This guide will walk you through the core features in about 5 minutes, giving you a solid understanding of how the application works.

## Before You Begin

Make sure you have:

- ‚úÖ Completed the [Installation](/getting-started/installation) process
- ‚úÖ The development server running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- ‚úÖ A web browser open and ready

## 1. Homepage Overview (30 seconds)

Start at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) - this is your application's front door.

**What you'll see:**

- **Welcome message** introducing Domi Health
- **Two main action buttons:**
  - **"View Patients"** - Access the patient management system
  - **"Admin Dashboard"** - Administrative functions
- **Feature highlights** showing key capabilities

**Healthcare Context:** This landing page serves as a quick access point for different user roles - administrators who need to add patients, and healthcare staff who need to access patient information.

## 2. Patient Management Workflow (2 minutes)

Let's follow the typical workflow of a healthcare team managing patients.

### Step 1: Add Your First Patient

1. **Click "Admin Dashboard"** from the homepage
2. **You'll see the patient registration form**
3. **Enter a patient name** (try "Maria Rodriguez")
4. **Click "Add Patient"**

**Expected result:** Green success message confirming the patient was added.

**Real-world context:** This simulates the intake process when a new patient is referred to your home healthcare service.

### Step 2: View Patient List

1. **Click "View Patients"** (or navigate to `/patient`)
2. **You'll see your newly added patient** in a clean, organized list
3. **Notice the patient information displayed:**
   - Full name
   - Truncated Patient ID (for privacy)
   - Registration date

**Healthcare workflow:** This view gives care teams quick access to their patient roster, similar to a daily assignment list.

### Step 3: Access Patient Details

1. **Click on the patient card** you just created
2. **Explore the patient detail page:**
   - **Basic Information section** with full patient data
   - **Medical Records placeholder** (future feature)
   - **Appointments placeholder** (future feature)

**Clinical perspective:** This detailed view is where healthcare providers would access comprehensive patient information before a home visit.

## 3. Navigation System (1 minute)

Understanding the navigation will help you move efficiently through the application.

### Sidebar Navigation (Desktop)

On larger screens, you'll see a persistent sidebar with:

- **üè† Home** - Return to the main dashboard
- **üë• Patients** - Patient list and management
- **‚öôÔ∏è Admin** - Administrative functions

### Mobile Navigation

On mobile devices:

- **Hamburger menu** (‚â°) in the top-left corner
- **Same navigation options** in a collapsible menu
- **Responsive design** that works on any device size

**Practical tip:** The sidebar highlights your current location, making it easy to navigate during busy workdays.

## 4. Understanding the Data Flow (1 minute)

Here's what happens behind the scenes when you add a patient:

1. **Form Validation** - The system ensures required fields are filled
2. **Data Processing** - Patient information is formatted and validated
3. **Database Storage** - Securely stored in Supabase (PostgreSQL)
4. **Real-time Updates** - Patient list automatically refreshes
5. **UUID Generation** - Each patient gets a unique, secure identifier

**Security note:** Patient IDs are UUIDs (universally unique identifiers), providing better security than sequential numbers.
